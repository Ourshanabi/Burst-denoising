# Burst-denoising
Reproducing the results of https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.057907

The code to reproduce the training database for the bursts is available here: https://github.com/cmla/f16-video-set

HDR+ Dataset https://hdrplusdata.org/

Pytorch version : 1.0

TO DO:
 
-Implement a version trainingfunction that concatenate one denoised burst then computing the loss burst wise (and not imagewise)
