# Burst-denoising
Reproducing the results of https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.057907

The code to reproduce the training database for the bursts is available here: https://github.com/cmla/f16-video-set

HDR+ Dataset https://hdrplusdata.org/

Pytorch version : 1.0

TO DO:
 
-Implement a version trainingfunction that concatenate one denoised burst then computing the loss burst wise (and not imagewise)

Following this internship, the second part of the [MVA](https://link-url-here.org) course :  [Image denoising : the human machine competition](https://www.master-mva.com/cours/image-denoising-the-human-machine-competition/) was created.
Follow it If you want to learn how to do this in a more structure way ;)
